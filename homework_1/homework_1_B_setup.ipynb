The data we are using in this exercise come from observations that Pascal Storck did as part of his PhD at the University of Washington in the mid- to late 1990s. The measurements were made in southern Oregon on the west slope of the Cascade mountains, an area in the transient snow zone that receives a lot of precipitation in winter. One of the goals of the work was to examine the effects of forest harvest practices on snow and hydrology. The first HRU represents a forest clearing, while the second hru represents a forested site."
